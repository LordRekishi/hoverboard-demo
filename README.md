# Hoverboard demo

This demo is made while following [an amazing tutorial](https://youtu.be/HtunPQtr-Xw) made by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia). It demonstrates an easy way to animate boxes getting a random color applied to them with a glow effect when hovering with your mouse.

### Screenshots

#### When hovering the mouse over boxes they turn a random color for 2 seconds then fading out
